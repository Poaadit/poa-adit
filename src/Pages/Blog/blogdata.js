        <br/>,
        "The demand for decent housing is high in Nigeria, a country with a population of over 167 million and a growing middle class. The Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria estimates that the country has a housing shortage of 17 million units. While new real estate projects are popping up in Abuja and Lagos, they account for only 1% of Nigeria's requirements. As the middle class continues to grow, there are numerous opportunities to be exploited.",

According to the statistics agency, the services sector, including retail services, contributed the most to Nigeria's latest rebased GDP, accounting for 51%. McKinsey predicts that yearly consumer goods sales might more than triple to $1.4 trillion by 2030, up from $388 billion. This explains multinational firms like Unilever Plc, Nestle Plc, and Shoprite Holdings' expansion plans. Shoprite, a South African-based supermarket, has announced plans to open dozens of additional retail locations across Nigeria.",

        details: "A Beginner's Guide To Securing Funding For Real Estate Development",
        details2: ["Real estate development often requires external funding to cover property acquisition, planning, construction, and other expenses. Home construction loans can be a secure way to finance a home improvement project, starting as a short-term, high-interest loan and converting into a mortgage once the work is done.",
        <br/>,
        <br/>,
        "Most banks and credit unions offer these loans, with approval depending on your credit score and your contractor's financial standing and previous projects. The bank pays the contractor in monthly draws, with the owner usually making interest-only payments during construction. These loans typically have higher interest rates than regular mortgages but can be repaid over 15 to 30 years once converted.",

        <br/>,
        "Money partners, which can include private lenders and companies seeking properties to invest in, can also provide funding for larger residential or multi-family projects. However, the application process varies, and it's essential to research each partner's practices to ensure they're reputable and align with your needs.",
        <br/>,
        <br/>,
        "Development finance is another option for funding more significant, longer-term development initiatives, ranging from property restoration to large-scale hotel or manufacturing developments. The loan is secured by the land you're building on and the property or properties you're developing, with additional properties used as collateral if necessary. Payments can be made in installments, covering the cost of the land or property initially and then releasing smaller sums to cover construction costs.",
        <br/>,
        <br/>,
        "Like bridging, development finance requires an exit strategy, usually involving selling the development or refinancing the loan into a long-term mortgage product. Whether you choose a home construction loan, money partner, or development finance, it's crucial to do your research and consult experts to determine the best option for your residential building project.",
